    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;  //this create a reference not a copy;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3]='Lux';
    console.log(team);
    console.log(players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    //const team2 = players.slice();  //exact copy nnot referece
    
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
   // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; //create a copy
    team[3]= 'hello';
    console.log(team4);
    console.log(players);

    const team5 = Array.from(players); // create a copy
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const caps = person;
    // person.number = 99;
    // console.log(caps);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const caps2 = Object.assign({},person , {number : 99 , age : 34});
    console.log(caps2);
    console.log(person);

    console.clear();

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const caps3 = { ...person};
    console.log(caps3)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    let dev2 = JSON.stringify(wes);// this is possible way first change to string 
    console.log(dev2);

    dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));//then convert to objects and this did not chnge the original obj
